# How to get what users or update policy are there for the EKS?

To give the users access.
- Go to AWS Console for EKS.
- Click on Access.
- Create a User or Edit Existing one.
- It will open a menu - cancle it to go back once for the user as that screen is misleading.
- Under "access policy" add "Cluster Admin" or something.
